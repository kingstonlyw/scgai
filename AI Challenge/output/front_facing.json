      "what_built": "I built a year-to-date ledger summarization tool using ChatGPT, which streamlines our monthly reporting process for actual expenses. The tool combines Excel queries and macros to quickly refresh and summarize our financial data, allowing for easy updates and analysis. It aggregates YTD expenses by vendor and account group, significantly reducing the time spent on reporting.",
      "challenge_addressed": "Previously, our team spent several days each month manually downloading and formatting reports from the ledger system, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. This cumbersome process limited our ability to update all expense categories efficiently. The manual nature of the task made it difficult to provide timely reports for budgeting and forecasting.",
      "outcome": "Now, I can refresh all pivot tables and queries in under 10 minutes, summarizing every account group by vendor and segment. This new process saves us one to two days of work each month and consolidates all account groupings into a single file, enhancing our ability to analyze expenses and update forecasts.",
      "cross_team_use": "Any team involved in financial reporting or forecasting can benefit from this tool, as it simplifies the process of pulling general ledger details into a reportable format. With some adjustments, other teams can adapt the queries and macros for their specific needs.",
