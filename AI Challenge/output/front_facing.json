    "title": "Excel Tool for Efficient YTD Expense Reporting",
    "cleaned": {
      "what_built": "I developed a year-to-date ledger summarization tool using ChatGPT, which streamlines our monthly reporting process for actual expenses. The tool integrates queries and macros in Excel, allowing for quick updates and easy access for the team. It summarizes YTD expenses by vendor and account group, significantly reducing the time spent on reporting.",
      "challenge_addressed": "Previously, our team spent several days each month manually downloading and formatting reports from the ledger system, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. This clunky process limited our ability to update all expense categories efficiently. The manual nature of the task made it challenging to produce timely and accurate reports for budgeting and forecasting.",
      "outcome": "Now, I can refresh all pivot tables and queries in under 10 minutes, providing a comprehensive summary of account groups by vendor and segment. This tool saves us one to two days of work each month and consolidates all account groupings into a single file, enhancing our ability to analyze expenses and update forecasts.",
      "cross_team_use": "Any team involved in financial reporting or forecasting can benefit from this tool, as it simplifies the process of pulling general ledger details into a reportable format. It eliminates the need for individual account ledger downloads and formatting, making reporting more efficient.",
