    "what_built": "I created a custom GPT that has Anaplan documentation as it's knowledge base, and uses GPT 5. The model is very helpful in figuring out why formulas aren't working properly and providing corrected formulas, as well as stepping through formulas to trace back how values are being calculated.",
    "challenge_addressed": "1. When creating formulas that are the same aside from changing line item identifiers, the model quickly can create a grid I can paste into Anaplan formula view\n2. If an Anaplan model is not pulling data correctly due to a dimension mismatch, the custom GPT can figure out where the disconnect is and show you how to fix it in seconds.\n3. For AM and PM team members with no Anaplan training, the model can help them write / change formulas, as well as understand how numbers are being calculated.",
    "outcome": "The model saves me a lot of time, as well as helps me with idea generation for formulas. It also reminds me of more obscure functions in Anaplan that I've used once and forgot about, which is helpful when I need to do something very specific.",
    "cross_team_use": "Yes, this model could help AMs and PMs who use Anaplan models but don't understand the back end work through formulas and make corrections for small changes, removing the need for an Anaplan Analyst to do it unless it is a more major undertaking.",

    "challenge_addressed": "1- As assistants, we spend far too long trying to track down who supports who.\nIt would be extremely helpful if a persons bio contained their EA contact information.\nThere is currently no way of knowing who a persons EA is and we often have to ask 3 or 4 different people.\nOnce we find out, it’s easy to forget or assistants leave / move to different departments and our notes can quickly become outdated.\nThis is a lot of manual effort for something that should be quite easy using AI.\n\n2 - I have found that when I process expenses, not every deal is set up in the Concur system.\nThis means I have to manually allocate the fund split and there is currently nowhere I can go to find that information.\nI am left with no choice but to to ask the asset manager who then has to dig it out of their inbox.\nIt would be extremely helpful if the intranet housed a basic database where we could accurately & quickly search all the deals and their fund splits.\nThis current process is inefficient and mistakes can easily be made.\nThis can then cause a bigger issue down the line when treasury are reimbursing monies back to employees, potentially from the wrong funds.\nA simple AI tool would solve this problem.",
    "outcome": "Both of these current issues have a direct and negative impact on business operations, especially from an EA perspective.\nThe result of these tools being implemented would be a huge amount of EA time saved, improved clarity on EA support, expenses reimbursed faster and accurately.\nIt would also free up time for EA's to focus on bigger projects and less waiting around for answers to questions that can be given much quicker using these tools.",
    "cross_team_use": "I believe everyone across the business would benefit from both of these AI tools being implemented.\nThe Concur team would have accurate expense reports being submitted and reimbursed from the correct fund and anyone could use the search tool to find the relevant EA when they're struggling to get hold of a particular person.",

    "what_built": "I built a Microsoft Power Automate Template using Chat GPT that sends an email every morning at 6:30 AM to my team with a table containing all of the projects we are currently working on. There are the following columns in the Starwood-colored table (due to coding the colors in Chat GPT Generated HTML) that is sent:\n\n• A column where we add the name of the project\n• A column where we indicate what the status of the project (Not Started, In Progress, Complete). Using Chat GPT I also coded in HTML so that the cells are color-coded based on status\n• A column where we can add due-dates for the projects. Using Chat GPT I coded in HTML so that the cells turn yellow if due within 3 days, turn orange if it is the due date, and turn red if it is overdue\n• A column where we can add additional notes\n\nTeam members can update the project tracker using an excel file shared via Sharepoint that is linked to the bottom. Having this living document that can be kept open at all times has been helpful as it is easy to update, and team leads have appreciated the visibility that the formatted export sent every morning provides into the progress on certain projects.\n\nLink to Sharepoint Excel Tracker that is exported via Power Automate: https://starwoodcapital-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/wkanders_starwood_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BDF1FA5D7-ACF5-4069-8E75-BB3A7CDDA1C3%7D&file=Automated%20Email%20Project%20Tracker.xlsx&wdLOR=c4C80E815-320D-4465-B1B8-54EE9CBB5E7A&action=default&mobileredirect=true",
    "challenge_addressed": "Our team, which has members in different countries/time-zones, frequently juggles a number of projects with varying due dates and nuances, so this tracker helps ensure that deliverables are on track to be completed on time, and that senior members of the team are aware of where certain projects currently stand.\n\nIt has reduced communication bottlenecks and knowledge gaps, and shortened our weekly meetings as people are more aware of where projects sit.",
    "outcome": "The outcome was that this became a tool that our team relies on each day. We all update the projects we are working on, and update the due-dates as needed.\n\nIt has also been a useful tool to hold ourselves accountable for self-imposed due-dates that otherwise might be forgotten.\n\nIt has saved us time putting together weekly agendas for our team catch ups, as the project- tracker emails almost serve as an agenda and contain details regarding how projects are going. We have saved time both planning the meetings, and on the meetings as people are more up to speed on various work flows.\n\nIn terms of quantifying the time saved, I believe we can solidly say it has saved at least 1 or 2 hours per week between planning for team catchups/time spent on calls. Additionally, I think always having a shared \"to-do\" list has made days more dynamic and productive.",
    "cross_team_use": "I believe this could be helpful for every team within the organization.\n\nI think whether it be the process for publishing QIU's or acquiring an asset, project trackers are invaluable, and the automated send every morning is a quick and effective way to keep people up to date on what is needed, and where things currently stand. I could see this daily send being helpful when completing an Acquisitions check list as the team could go down the list and see what items are outstanding and demand attention.",
    "surprise": "I was surprised how effectively Chat GPT helped me code the necessary HTML needed. The process was relatively intuitive, and I could figure out how to work through it despite not having a Computer Science background.\n\nI was also surprised that Chat GPT had great suggestions for how to elaborate on my initial idea and provide more nuanced code and functionality.\n\nPlease let me know if I can share the Power Automate Flow with anyone in particular.

    "what_built": "I developed a Python automation script that integrates with Microsoft Outlook to streamline the handling of securitization emails. The script automatically identifies messages from specific senders, extracts the securitization name from the subject line, ensures the correct folder structure exists in the Capital Markets database, and saves attachments consistently while avoiding duplicates. It maintains an error log for transparency and runs daily after market close via Windows Task Scheduler. This solution directly automates a repetitive task, improves accuracy, and standardizes file storage, delivering operational efficiency that aligns with the Capital Markets team’s need for reliability and speed.",
    "challenge_addressed": "The Capital Markets team receives hundreds of emails daily, creating a risk that important securitization materials could be overlooked. Because multiple analysts receive the same notifications, duplicate saving attempts could lead to confusion or wasted time. Manually handling these files also caused disruptive interruptions during the day. While the individual task wasn’t time-consuming, the lack of consistency and the constant context switching reduced productivity. By automating the process, the script ensures nothing is missed, prevents duplication, and enforces a standard file organization approach, directly supporting Starwood’s operational priorities of accuracy and efficiency in capital markets activities.",
    "outcome": "The automation saves an estimated 5–10 minutes per analyst each day and eliminates the distraction of manually processing securitization emails, leading to increased productivity and focus on higher-value analysis. It also creates consistency in how files are stored, removing stylistic differences between analysts and ensuring a clean, reliable archive. Beyond the time savings, the greater outcome is confidence—analysts no longer worry about missing, duplicating, or misfiling securitization materials. This strengthens the quality of operations, supports faster decision-making, and demonstrates how small-scale automation can deliver measurable business impact.",
    "cross_team_use": "Most definitely. One of the key lessons from my data science background is learning to think like a computer system: when a task is repetitive and the information follows a predictable structure, there is almost always an opportunity to automate it. While the specifics vary across teams, many departments handle routine tasks such as filing emails, organizing documents, or processing notifications. Just as this script extracts securitization names from subject lines, similar logic could be applied to other repetitive workflows. Whether through a Python script or even a trained language model, these small automations save meaningful time over months and years and allow employees to focus more on analysis, collaboration, and client relationships. These are the areas where human judgment adds the most value.",
    "surprise": "What surprised me most was how effectively AI could debug and enhance my ideas. It made the process seamless: I could provide rough drafts of code or even just pseudocode—essentially the plain-English version of each step—and the AI would generate useful outputs, along with tests at each stage.\n\nMy recording file is too large to attach here.

The GPT was first 'trained' on 18 example 'bullets' that had already been shared with back-leverage providers, and then refined through the 'Create' tab to output the desired format consistently.\n\nThe GPT follows a structured workflow of: take RFP/IM/Excel Model -> extract key financing facts -> rewrite them into a succinct, easily digestible set of bullets.\n\nThis workflow is rule-bound, governed by the following principles:\n1.  Outputs mirror precedent bullets and style guides used in lender marketing processes.\n2.  Bullets are concise, factual, and sales-leaning without being promotional.\n3.  No filler language, long dashes, or duplicated data between sections.\n4.  Equity returns metrics, sponsor opinions, or assumed details are excluded unless requested in the prompt.\n5.  Documents are read critically but never interpreted beyond what is written, ambiguous inputs are escalated for clarification.\n6.  Where key inputs (e.g. loan sizing, LTC or basis) are not provided, placeholder values in the form “[•]” are inserted and flagged below as 'Outstanding Placeholders'.\n\nOutputs take the following form:\n1.  Summary – One or two concise bullets describing the loan quantum, metrics (e.g. LTC / DY / £/€ psf/m/key), and business plan. Always begins with a standardised lead bullet format.\n2.  Portfolio – Description of the asset/portfolio, including location, tenancy, scale, and value drivers etc. Max six bullets.\n3.  Business Plan – Clear summary of the sponsor’s intended strategy to create, stabilise or unlock value. Max four bullets.\n4.  Sponsor – Factual overview of Sponsor/Operating Partner/Platform, AUM and sector experience (only where directly stated).\n5.  Deal Considerations – Placeholder bullet for internal use (e.g. pricing commentary, structuring points).",
    "challenge_addressed": "The key challenges with respect to the existing process were speed and consistency, as well as accuracy (to an extent). The Custom GPT has allowed dealt with these challenges and allowed for this manual task to be turned into a streamlined, standardised process.\n\nSpeed: Previously, preparation of repo bullets would take 45-60 minutes per deal, with a handful of deals being shared with the Capital Markets team for quotes each week. With the Custom GPT, it is now feasible to prepare bullets in as little as 5 mins with the bulk of the time coming from (i) confirmatory cross-checking of the output to the sponsor/broker materials, and (ii) populating placeholders intentionally left blank by the model.\n\nConsistency: With several members of the team preparing bullets, there was often a lack of consistency in format and level-of-detail. The Custom GPT always generates bullets in the same format. If additional detail is needed for specific deals, this can be requested in the prompt or added post hoc by the user.\n\nAccuracy: While accuracy was generally high for this workflow, the Custom GPT helps to ensure the facts line up with those communicated in any materials we receive (with a quick manual cross-check advised to ensure this is the case). Additionally, with this tool the preparation of a draft set of bullets can easily be given to an intern or new, entry-level joiner who is less familiar with the debt investment evaluation process.",
    "outcome": "First-order outcomes are outlined above but there also further benefits, some of which are listed below:\n\n- Capacity unlocked for higher-value work.\n- Scalability allows for handling of multiple early-stage live processes at once.\n- Training and onboarding benefits as the tool potentially serves as a means of edifying interns / new joiners who are not experienced in RE debt investments.\n- Allows for the establishment of a catalogue of comparable bullets that the team can reference in future processes (e.g. getting a quick summary of other deals of a specific asset class we have previously screened).\n- Speeds up the creation of long form materials like the IC memos as the bullets serve as a good base for an Executive Summary slide.",
    "cross_team_use": "In its current form, the Custom GPT is only useful for Debt Origination and Capital Markets. If a similar process exists in the US or Asia, there is also an opportunity to roll out the tool to these geographies.\n\nHowever, the core value of the GPT is turning raw inconsistent information into clean, standardised outputs in a timely fashion. As such, most, if not all Starwood departments could benefit from a tool of this nature - training data would need to be tailored to the specific use case, but a lot of the governing principles and restrictions placed upon the model could be reused.",
    "surprise": "I decided to play around with the Custom GPT functionality following the firmwide teach-in we had on August 7th. I was surprised to find out how much you can mould a Custom GPT as I was previously underutilising the 'Instruction' input. I also found the \"Create\" functionality, where you update the instructions using prompts, to be very helpful when refining the output.\n\nAll in all, the tool took around two hours to train and properly confirm, and has already saved the team and I much longer than this!",

This also can be downloaded as a PDF summary for the hiring manager.",

This has saved an incredible amount of time, especially for roles with many candidates, and I can evaluate candidates, provide updates on a more frequent basis to the hiring managers, and keep the recruiting process moving at a much faster pace. Now that I have built the workflow, I anticipate the outcome will only continue to improve as I continue providing feedback.

Recruiting and hiring the best talent in the industry is a pivotal component of success, and I believe this tool can assist in that process. As I mentioned above, as new roles open we can duplicate the baseline model and customize it to best match the role and team preferences. In time, this would create a library of models that recruiters can immediately put to use or at a minimum, give them a starting point that only requires small updates.",

It is difficult to quantify how many hours this has saved in aggregate, but each time we have one of these rollup projects, it saves several hours of work. Also, they have improved productivity. As mentioned, these codes can run in the background, so it is possible to work on other things (emails, PowerPoint, etc.) while these codes run in the background.",

    "what_built": "I developed a Python automation script that integrates with Microsoft Outlook to streamline the handling of securitization emails. The script automatically identifies messages from specific senders, extracts the securitization name from the subject line, ensures the correct folder structure exists or creates it if not in the Capital Markets database, and saves attachments consistently while avoiding duplicates. It maintains an error log for transparency and runs daily after market close via Windows Task Scheduler. This solution directly automates a repetitive task, improves accuracy, and standardizes file storage, delivering operational efficiency that aligns with the team’s need for reliability and speed.",
    "challenge_addressed": "The Capital Markets team receives hundreds of emails daily, creating a risk that important securitization materials could be overlooked. Because multiple analysts receive the same notifications, duplicate saving attempts often led to confusion or wasted time. Manually handling these files also caused disruptive interruptions during the day. While the individual task wasn’t time-consuming, the lack of consistency and the constant context switching reduced productivity. By automating the process, the script ensures nothing is missed, prevents duplication, and enforces a standard file organization approach, directly supporting Starwood’s operational priorities of accuracy and efficiency in activities.",
    "outcome": "The automation saves an estimated ~5–10 minutes per analyst each day and eliminates the distraction of manually processing securitization emails, leading to increased productivity and focus on higher-value analysis. It also creates consistency in how files are stored, removing stylistic differences between analysts and ensuring a clean, reliable archive. Beyond the time savings, the greater outcome is confidence—analysts no longer worry about missing, duplicating, or misfiling securitization materials. This strengthens the quality of operations, supports faster decision-making, and demonstrates how small-scale automation can deliver measurable business impact.",
    "cross_team_use": "Absolutely. Many teams at Starwood handle repetitive tasks where information follows predictable patterns, whether it’s processing notifications, filing reports, or organizing shared documents. The same approach—using Python scripts or AI-assisted tools—can be adapted to these workflows with minimal customization. One of the key lessons from my data science education is that when tasks are repetitive and structured, they are strong candidates for automation. By scaling these kinds of solutions, the company can reduce low-value repetitive work across departments and free up employees to focus on analysis, client relationships, and strategic decision-making where human judgment adds the most value.",
    "surprise": "What surprised me most was how effective ChatGPT was in turning messy code and rough pseudocode into a fully functional script. The debugging support was especially valuable—the back-and-forth process made it easy to identify issues quickly, and I was able to layer in multiple checkpoints to pinpoint where problems might occur. This made development more efficient than expected and highlighted how AI can accelerate both learning and execution, especially for someone applying coding skills in a real business context.\n\nI want to point out that the demo was run using my own Outlook account, but in practice the automation is designed to run on my VP’s account since he receives all the relevant emails from these contacts. This shows that while the script is flexible enough to run on different mailboxes, it will ultimately be deployed where the workflow is most centralized.",

    "what_built": "Through the help of ChatGPT I was able to build a year to date ledger summarization/reporting tool that helps me and our team on our monthly reporting process for actual expenses paid year to date. I asked the chat how to summarize my general ledger fast and easy to help me save time, and the solution provided was to use queries and macros in excel. I am not familiar with queries but I followed its recommendations and was able to build a new ledger reporting file that allows for very fast updates and easy to use for anyone on my team.\n\nThe excel file itself is a combination of queries (i.e. linking the raw data with mapping identifiers that I built) and macros. The file allows me to easily refresh the raw data to get pulled into a summary file, and then a couple of macros that aggregate the summary by account grouping and then another macro that generates the top 5 expense categories and the top 10 vendors in those specific account groups.  This file combines all of our YTD expense details and helps to summarize them by vendor to help for understanding the drivers of the expense groups.\n\nThe goal/best part of the file is that all I have to do now is download the raw GL for the month from our ledger system, save it to a specific folder and then go into my file and hit refresh and I am done. The summary file will go into the folder, find the files saved down, pull those files, map them the way that I want (i.e. by Segment, account group and then by vendor), remove the details that I dont need, and then generate the result in fresh tab in the summary file. Once the summary tab is created I hit 2 macros that I had ChatGPT create for me. The first macro creates a new tab for every single account group, it creates a pivot table on that tab, organized by Segment and Vendor, and sorts each segment from the highest to lowest expense. This way we can easily look into each account group and see what the key drivers of that expense are, by segment. If I want to include more details in the pivots or the summary, I just simply go to the query and update the filters I have in place there to summarize the details.\n\nOur ledger has roughly 8,0000-10,000 rows of details a month, which is aggregated into 45 different account groups spread over 10 segments/departments. By year end we may have over 100K rows of details which can now be summarized in a few minutes through this new file that ChatGPT helped me create. My current file through September has aggregated the data down to 22,000 rows (which could be trimmed smaller if I want less details) and it does so quickly.",
    "challenge_addressed": "Every month our team had to go into the ledger system, download a report for each of the specific account groups, format it to the mapping we need (by reporting segment and what not), create a pivot table and then organize the pivot table. This was a time consuming process and usually would take a few days every month to update, and because of the time it took we would only do this for the main expense categories in the essence to time. It was a clunky process and required saving each account group file down individually and multiple levels of review to ensure that everything was being captured correctly and as expected. It was a very manual process which room for error and took a great deal of time to prepare, but was a very helpful and useful exercise for our reporting.\n\nThese reports did help to update the SCG consolidated budgets and forecasts, along with any Ad Hoc Requests, and were viewed as a critical part of the forecasting process, but it was difficult to get them updated in a efficent and timely manor.",
    "outcome": "With the use of the queries and the macros, I am able to refresh all the pivot tables and query in less than 10 mins and have every single account group summarized by vendor and segment which we have not historically been able to do. In addition, I have the top 5 expense reporting tool that is helpful incase management wants a quick update of the main expense categories. This saves a day or two worth of work every month and gives us more and cleaner expense reporting than we previously had. Now we can spend more time reviewing and analyzing the expense, as opposed to spending time preparing the files.\n\nAnother added benefit is simply having all of these account groupings in one file vs 20 or so individual files. This allows us to easily flip from one account group to the next without having to go back to the folder to try to find the additional excel files. This makes it easier to update our forecasts and provide feedback for any adhoc requests we might have.",
    "cross_team_use": "Yes - Any team that does financial reporting or forecasting could benefit from the use of queries and macros, and this file (after some tweaking for their specific needs). This is a quick way to pull all general ledger details into a reportable format instead of downloading the individual account ledger details, format/map the details, create a pivot table, etc. to get to the results needed.",
    "surprise": "The speed at which queries can update and how easy they actually are to build once you have a basic understanding of them. I am going to try to roll this concept out to other areas that i work on and try to integrate the pulls into my monthly forecast files.",

    "what_built": "We implemented a business-specific workflow using ChatGPT to compile and standardize SFR deal annexes. While the annexes are delivered in Excel with each property as a row, the challenge is that the key fields we need are not always labeled the same way or located in the same columns across deals. Historically, this meant manually scanning through 50+ columns to find the right fields, then rebuilding our calculations on top of them for each annex. ChatGPT eliminates this bottleneck by automatically identifying and extracting the necessary fields (unit counts, balances, NOI, NCF, valuations, etc.), regardless of naming or column order, and applying our performance metrics (yields, cap rates, margins). The model then organizes the standardized output by vintage and MSA, which is how our team evaluates deals. This has replaced a highly manual, error-prone process with a clean, comparable dataset that is decision-ready in a fraction of the time.",
    "challenge_addressed": "This directly addressed the challenge of manual effort and inconsistency. Each SFR deal annex can contain 1,000+ rows with dozens of property-level columns, and those columns are rarely consistent from deal to deal. Without this workflow, analysts had to comb through 50+ columns per annex, identify where the key information was hidden, and then rebuild calculations from scratch. Not only was this highly time-consuming, but it also introduced opportunities for error and inconsistency across deals. ChatGPT solved both problems by automatically mapping and standardizing the key data fields, applying the calculations we care about, and outputting them in a format aligned with how we analyze deals.",
    "outcome": "The outcome has been a dramatic improvement in efficiency, clarity, and reliability. What previously required hours to days of manual work per deal can now be completed in minutes. Instead of hunting through annex columns and rebuilding formulas, we now receive a fully standardized dataset with the relevant fields extracted and performance metrics already calculated. This has led to an 80–90% reduction in manual effort per deal, freeing analysts to focus on interpretation and strategy rather than data wrangling. The outputs are consistently organized by vintage and MSA, the exact lens we use to evaluate portfolios, which improves clarity and speeds decision-making. Overall, the automation allows us to handle more deals in parallel without adding headcount, delivering measurable productivity gains and higher-quality, decision-ready insights.",
    "cross_team_use": "Yes, this approach is highly scalable across other teams at Starwood. While we built it for SFR annexes, the underlying challenge—large Excel files with inconsistent formats and critical data in varying columns—exists across many asset classes. Our multifamily, hospitality, and office teams face similar issues with property annexes, rent rolls, or operating statements. By adapting this framework, those teams could automatically extract and standardize the fields they care about, apply their own calculations, and generate consistent outputs. Beyond property-level data, the workflow could also support portfolio management, underwriting, or investor reporting, where standardized data is critical for cross-asset analysis. Because the process relies on adaptable logic rather than rigid formulas, it can be scaled quickly across teams with minimal customization, creating broad operational value.",
    "surprise": "What surprised us most was how well the workflow handled the variability across annexes. We expected it to speed up manual work, but we didn’t anticipate how effectively it could normalize inconsistent formats across deals and still deliver clean, comparable outputs. I was also impressed by how easily the process could be extended with new calculations or views—adding yield, margin, or MSA-level performance required minimal adjustment. In short, it didn’t just save time; it worked more flexibly and reliably than expected, giving us confidence to expand its use to new datasets and asset types quickly.\n\nThe Excel submission we provided shows our manual verification of all numbers, confirming that the ChatGPT workflow produced accurate results. This cross-check took multiple hours to complete, but it was worth the effort to validate that the model worked correctly across all the deals we tested. The first two sheets highlight that there were no discrepancies across any row or column, which gave us confidence that the automation was not only faster but also reliable and precise. This validation step was important to demonstrate that the workflow could be trusted as a repeatable process for future annexes.",

I trained the GPT to follow a specific structure: beginning with a brief property summary, followed by Sponsor background and business plan, bullet-pointed deal strengths, underwriting assumptions, and loan economics. This ensures consistency, clarity, and alignment with institutional communication standards.",
    "challenge_addressed": "This custom GPT addresses the manual effort and inconsistency in preparing external-facing deal summaries.
